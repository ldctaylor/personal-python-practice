Hey, man, I'm alive (1)
I'm taking each day and night at a time (2)
I'm feeling like a Monday... (3)
But someday I'll be Saturday night (4)
Yeah my name is Jim, where did I go wrong (5)
My life's a bargain basement, all the good shit's gone (6)
I just can't hold a job, where did I go wrong? (7)
Been sleeping in my car, my dreams moved on (8)
